# pMixPlugin - Plug-in version

A VST2, VST3 and AudioUnit version of pMix. Possibly LV2 in the future.

**Requirements:**

Currently JUCE must be patched in order to avoid a deadlock when AudioProcessorGraph is used in a plug-in setting. The included JuceLibraryCode should allready be patched, but if you update it you may need to repatch. See http://www.juce.com/forum/topic/ableton-live-deadlock-plugin-audioprocessorgraph
